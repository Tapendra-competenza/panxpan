        data to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing data
        requested to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law.
        We may also decline to process requests that jeopardize the privacy of others,
        are extremely impractical, or would cause us to take any action that is not
        permissible under applicable laws. Additionally, as permitted by applicable
        laws, we may need to retain certain personal information for a limited period
        of time for record-keeping, accounting and fraud prevention purposes.
