        <strong>Article 1 &ndash; Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We may amend this Terms of Service and any linked
        information from time to time by posting amended terms on the Platform, without
        notice to you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Our platform is an online venue for manufactures to find and
        work with local partners.&nbsp; Manufacturers and local partners must register for
        an account in order to work together via the platform. Manufactures provide
        interest to sell their products in certain countries by adding products to our
        Platform and launching proposals.&nbsp; Local partners from those countries apply to
        these proposals.&nbsp; Each proposal contains a sales forecast and an investment
        required forecast.&nbsp; If both the manufacturer and local partner agree to the
        sales and investment forecast, they may enter into a venture on the platform.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Once in a venture the local partner orders goods via the
        platform and the manufacturer funds investment based on the agreed upon
        investment forecast.&nbsp; Actual investment paid out is based on receipts
        submitted.&nbsp; Our fees which pay for platform running costs and money transfer
        expenses are based on a percentage of sales and investment that go through the
        platform.&nbsp; We are not a party to any contractual agreements between manufacturers
        and local partners in the online venue, we merely facilitate connections
        between the parties and enforce platform guidelines where applicable.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        You must also, at our request, provide copies of
        identification documents (such as your passport or drivers' license). We may
        also ask you to provide photographic identification holding a sign with a code
        that we provide as an additional identity verification step.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We reserve the right to close, suspend, or limit access to

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        You agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a
        result of your breach of this Terms of Service will be substantial and will
        potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses
        imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be
        extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain; (2) if you breach this
        Terms of Service, we may take legal action against you to recover losses.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result
        of your breach of this Terms of Service, unless as otherwise specified in this
        Terms of Service, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to
        you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">

        claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of
        your Account.

        We reserve the right to suspend a payout request if the

      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If we become aware that any funds received into an Account
        from another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will be
        reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must
        pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or
        cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those funds.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        1.&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe there may be an unacceptable level
        of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions,
        including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to
        reversal or chargeback;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        2.&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe that the beneficiary of the payment

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain

        the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your
        favor, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to
        you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favor, we may remove the funds from
        your Account. We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances where
        we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behavior, while we
        investigate any such matter.

        resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR
        providers that PanXpan will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties
        must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by
        telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific
        manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the
        arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
        witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment

        <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pricing &amp; Fees</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Manufactures post products on the Platform and then launch
        proposals identifying target countries, sales/investment targets and local
        partner responsibilities.&nbsp; Local partners apply to these proposals and if the
        application is approved by the Manufacturer a venture is formed between the
        Local Partner and Manufacturer.&nbsp; Once a venture is formed Local Partners will
        start ordering goods from the Manufacturer.&nbsp; PanXpan takes a 10% service fee
        for any sales generated via the platform.&nbsp; This fee is already built into the
        product pricing that local partners see and is paid for by the Manufacturer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In addition local partners request investment to build the
        manufacturer&rsquo;s presence in their country.&nbsp; This investment forecast is also
        included in their application and can be used for tasks such as customer
        service, sales, marketing, logistics, etc.&nbsp; PanXpan charges the local partner a
        10% service fee for any investment received via the platform.&nbsp; This service fee
        is already incorporated into the investment request seen by manufacturers and
        is paid for by local partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The service fees charged by PanXpan are used to pay for
        Platform running costs, money transfer expenses and currency conversion costs.

        <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Escrow &amp; Online Funds Balance</span>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        PanXpan holds funds in Escrow for local partners and
        manufacturers during the order and investment process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The order process starts with local partners making a
        product request to manufacturers they are entered into a venture with.&nbsp; Once a
        product request has been made, the manufacturer can approve, decline or ask to
        update the product request.&nbsp; If approved, the local partner is then required to
        fund the product request.&nbsp; This funding is held in escrow by the Platform until
        the Manufacturer ships the goods.&nbsp; Once the goods have been shipped and
        shipping confirmation entered, the Platform shares this confirmation with the
        local partner and the funds are released to the Manufacturer.&nbsp; If the goods are
        not shipped by the manufacturer by the deadline set in the Platform, local
        partner funds held in Escrow by the Platform are returned to the local partner.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The investment process starts with the pre-approved monthly
        investment amounts agreed to within the venture.&nbsp; Before a given month starts,
        the manufacturer is required to pre-fund that investment amount.&nbsp; The Platform
        holds these funds in Escrow during the month as the local partner spends the
        money.&nbsp; Once the month is over, the local partner must submit all receipts of
        money spent by the deadline set in the platform.&nbsp; The manufacturer can also
        dispute any of the receipts directly within the platform.&nbsp; Once the receipt
        submission and dispute deadline ends, any non-disputed receipts are paid to the
        local partner from the escrow funds and then remaining escrow funds are
        released back to the manufacturer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In addition, manufacturers and local partners have the
        option of withdrawing their Escrow funds (once available) to their online
        Platform account.&nbsp; Our Platform is not a bank or financial institution so any
        funds you may have in your online account at the end of each calendar month
        will be automatically withdrawn to your default payout account.&nbsp; No interest
        will be paid at any time for your online funds balance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">If your Account has negative funds, we may:</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        1.&nbsp;&nbsp; set-off the negative amount with funds that
        you subsequently receive into your Account;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        2.&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have funds in multiple currencies in
        your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may
        set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency
        (at an exchange rate applied by us);
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        3.&nbsp;&nbsp; reverse payments you have made from your
        Account to other User Accounts on the Platform;
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        4.&nbsp;&nbsp; deduct amounts you owe us from money you
        subsequently add or receive into your Account; or
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        5.&nbsp;&nbsp; immediately suspend or limit your Account
        until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds
        pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of
        your Account.&nbsp; We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any
        other legal means.

        that you used to make the original payment to us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User
        has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that
        we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the
        User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to
        the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to
        time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent;
        (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole
        opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a
        credit card chargeback.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Your first withdrawal of funds earned may be delayed for up
        to fifteen days for security and fraud purposes.&nbsp; Subsequent withdrawals may be
        delayed for up to fifteen days where our fraud prevention policies require a
        delay.&nbsp; We may impose a minimum or maximum withdrawal amount for payouts you
        try to make via the Platform. &nbsp;&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that we may seek to

        by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Upon a manufacturer sending a venture request to a local
        partner, the local partner&rsquo;s acceptance of the venture request and a
        manufacturer&rsquo;s acceptance of a product request on the Platform, the manufacturer
        and local partner will be deemed to have entered into a Contract under which
        the Buyer agrees to purchase, and the Seller agrees to deliver the agreed upon
        services. You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict
        with the Terms of Service.
      </p>

        You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with

        User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common
        law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you
        as a user of the Platform.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are
        solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the
        avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a
        User Contract.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Depending on their jurisdiction, local partners and
        manufacturers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot lawfully
        be excluded. Nothing in this Terms of Service is intended to override a right
        that by applicable law may not be excluded. Nothing in this Terms of Service is
        intended to violate any laws relating to unfair contracts. To the extent that

      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        All claims you bring against PanXpan must be resolved in
        accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All claims filed or brought
        contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of
        this Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to the terms of this
        Agreement, PanXpan may recover its legal fees and costs (including in-house
        lawyers and paralegals), provided that PanXpan has notified you in writing of
        the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        You agree that you will not pursue any claims arising under
        this Terms of Service on a class or other representative basis and will not
        seek to coordinate or consolidate any arbitration or action hereunder with any
        other proceeding.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any
        provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, PanXpan will be entitled to
        recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
        expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.

      <br />
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        PanXpan&rsquo;s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or
        others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar
        breaches.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This agreement supersedes any other agreement between you
        and PanXpan. If any part of this document is found to be unenforceable, that
        part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this document will
        otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of
        this document is not a waiver of any of our rights to later enforce that or any
        other part of this documents. We may assign any of our rights and obligations
        under this document from time to time.

        If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or
        between users and any third party, you agree that the Company is under no
        obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or
        more other users, you release the PanXpan, its officers, employees, agents, and
        successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or
        unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or
        in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a
        California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code
        Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims
        which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the
        time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have
        materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."

        We use your information as described in the PanXpan Privacy
        Policy. If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way
        then you must not use our services. For the avoidance of doubt, your name and

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        You will indemnify us (and our officers, directors, agents,
        subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) against any claim or demand,
        including legal fees and costs, made against us by any third party due to or

        You must immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any
        unauthorised access or any other security breach to the Platform, your Account
        or the PanXpan Services and do everything possible to mitigate the unauthorised
        access or security breach (including preserving evidence and notifying
        appropriate authorities). Your User Account is yours only, and you must not
        share your password with others. You are solely responsible for securing your

        This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws
        of the State of California. We encourage you to try and resolve disputes using
        certified mediation (such as online dispute resolution processes). If a dispute

        jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California.

        The provisions of this Terms of Service are severable, and
        if any provision of this Terms of Service is held to be invalid or

        any time, or to a third party without your consent in the event of a sale or
        other transfer of some or all of our assets. In the event of any sale or
        transfer you will remain bound by this Terms of Service.
